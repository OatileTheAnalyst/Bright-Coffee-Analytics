# Bright-Coffee-Analytics
Coffee Shop sales analysis to provide insights for new CEO.
 
 I analysed a data set which captures daily transactional information from a coffee shop. 
 Hypothesis: The business has recently appointed a new CEO whose mission is to grow the companyâ€™s revenue and improve product performance. As a Junior Data Analyst, I have extracted actionable insights from historical data and prepared a presentation to assist the CEO in decision-making. 
 
 The project answers the following questions:
 - Which products generate the most revenue 
 -  What time of day the store performs best 
 -  Sales trends across products and time intervals 
 -  Recommendations for improving sales performance

 For this process, I utilised the following tools:
 - SQL (Snowflake), to create extra columns for easier analysis
 - Excel, to analyse the data and visualise insights
 - Miro, to plan actions for the project.
